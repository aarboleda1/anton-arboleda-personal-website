				<p>Anyone can be a software engineer!

99% graduating rate of 100K!

Anyone can learn to code!

Coding is easy!

With the plethora of online tutorials, coding bootcamps and online resources it is easy to see why learning to code has turned into a widespread get rich quick scheme for anyone who can use a computer. For those of you interested in learning code and turning into a career here are two things I have experienced since immersing myself into the world of web development.

1) <strong>Coding is hard</strong>

Whoever said coding was easy must have lived in Codetopia: a utopian society where everyone thinks in code, talks in code and acts like a computer. Unfortunately, we humans are not from this place. Code is hard. Computers are stubborn, logical, and complex machines who will only listen when <strong>we </strong>speak <strong>their </strong>language. Learning how to do this takes time, patience, discipline and loads of caffeine (coffee is a must for those groggy mornings and late nights).

2) <strong>Beware: The Honeymoon Phase</strong>

Aaahhh the Honeymooon Phase.  Whether it be romantic relationship or learning a new skill, the Honeymoon Phase can leave us thinking: this is amazing! I love (insert lover, new hobby or food) here so much!

Programming full time is no different. So you have decided you want to be a web developer. You take tutorials such as Codecademy and TeamTreehouse and think, wow this is not that difficult, what is everyone so worked up about? These days are filled with hours of hand holding tutorials telling you what to type and where to type and all of sudden...voila! You understand everything right?! Wrong. In my own experience, in the first few days  of learning how to write a variable and create a function, I thought to myself "this is really not that hard", "man, I am going to be a master in no time". Boy was I wrong. The jump from simple for loops to writing complex lines of code <strong>will </strong>take blood, sweat, and tears (ok maybe not blood). But, once you are out of this honeymoon period, be ready to be utterly confused and frustrated at the fact you just don't understand things. Don't worry though, I know it sounds hard, but do your best to embrace the struggle. Know that everyone who has been where you were. And lastly, remember, if your not struggling you're not being challenged, and if you're not being challenged, you're not learning.

3) <b>Tough it out and reap the rewards</b>

After the realizing that code is hard and you no longer in the Honeymoon phase you soon realize that every software engineer has gone through this epiphany. Code is a difficult skill and that is a great thing. This weeds out those unwilling to struggle but rewards those who have the grit to get through long hard days of coding and debugging . Here are some of the rewards that constantly motivate me to pursue this career path.
<ul>
	<li>building useful things</li>
	<li>the ability to start my own business in the future</li>
	<li>the ability to create what I want</li>
	<li>comfortable salary and perks</li>
	<li>expanded career opportunities</li>
</ul>
These are the things that keep me motivated to learning code and to continue to master this craft. I hope this can inspire you as well.

To all those just starting out- get ready to be challenged!

And to all those outside of the Honeymoon Phase- know that better days lie ahead!
